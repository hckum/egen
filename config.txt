# CONFIGURATION FILE TO THE ERROR GENERATION SIMULATOR
# USAGE:
#   rate : the overall error rate
#   rate_missing : the rate of missing error
#   rate_swap : the rate of swap error (swap between fields or months/days)
#   rate_typo : the rate of typo errors
#   rate_vari : the rate of name variation errors

rate = 0.03
rate_missing = 0.2
rate_swap = 0.1
rate_typo = 0.6
rate_vari = 0.1

# FIELD SELECTION
# select some fields from the original data
# separated with comma

field = voter_reg_num, last_name, first_name, birth_age, name_sufx_cd
output = voter_reg_num, last_name, first_name, dob

# PROBABILITIES OF TYPO ERRORS
# probability of insertion, deletion, transposition, substitution
# usually no need to change this part

prob_insertion = 0.4
prob_deletion = 0.3
prob_transpose = 0.15
prob_substitution = 0.15
